### Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | NpSQL |
| --- | --- |
|Uses SQL (structured query language) for defining/manipulating data|Uses UnQL (unstructured query language =) for manipulating data|
|Data is stored in table|Data is stored on documents, key:value pairs, graphs or wide-columns|
|Have predefined schema|Have dynamic schema for unstructured data|
|Can scaled vertically|Can scale horizontally|

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
* SQL are suitable for environments that require complex and intensive queries.

Give a real world example.
* An example of a good use of a SQL database would be to support a CPU intensive server such as a gaming server.

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
* NoSQL databases are suitable for applications that need to scale horizontally.

Give a real world example.
* A NoSQL database is useful when you need to scale out. An example would be to support data backup and redundancy across multiple servers to support disaster recovery efforts.

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
* NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

Which type of database is best for scalability?
* It depends. SQL databases are suitable if you want to scale vertically. However, NoSQL databases are suitable for when you need to scale horizontally.
