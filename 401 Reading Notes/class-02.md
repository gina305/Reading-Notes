# Testings and Modules

## Unit Tests

A unit test is a small, testable part of code whose input, output and behavior is tested against an expected result.

## Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of modifying code without changing it external behavior or functonality.

Unit tests may reveal that code needs to be modified. This is where refactoring comes in. For example, if we needed to change code inside a function to apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, we would refactor the code. However, the unit tests associated to that same function should still pass.

## Recursion
Recursion is the process of breaking down a problem into smaller, repeatable tasks. The primary feature that defines recursion is that a recursive function calls itself, either directly or indirectly during execution.

## Test-Driven Development

Test-Driven development is the process of writing unit tests before writing your code. Use the red, green, refactor approah. Red, Green, Refactor
The red, green, refactor approach helps developers compartmentalize their focus into three phases:

* Red — think about what you want to develop
* Green — think about how to make your tests pass
* Refactor — think about how to improve your existing implementation

Here's a visual representation (by Code Academy).
