## Test Coverage
Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase. Keep in mind that:
* high coverage numbers are too easy to reach with low quality testing (i.e. assertion free testing).

* 

## Random Module in Python
You can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5.

The following example shows how to import the random function and use it to generate a random number
```python
import random  #Import thr random function

#Define a list of names
names = ['Benny', 'Dwight', 'Deonte', 'Davuda']

#Generate a random number between 0 and the length of the array minus 1(inclusive)
num = random.randint(0, names.__len__() - 1)

# Print a random item from the list
print(names[num])

```
