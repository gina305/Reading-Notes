# Read: 14a - CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## CSS Transforms
The CSS 'transforms' property allows you to position and alter elements. The transform property comes with two different settings, 2D and 3D settings. Not all browsers support this property but support is growing. The transform property should be prefixed with vendor prefixes to gain the best support across all browsers. Here are the 2D transforms properties you can use to change the position or alter an element:

* rotate 
* matrix
* perspective
* perspective-origin
* scale 
* skew 
* transition
* transform-origin

The 3D settings have their own properties you can set as well.


## CSS Animations

CSS Animations let you gradually change an element from one style to another. Animations allow you more control than transitions and are useful when you need to have multiple states. You can use animation keyframes to set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition. To do so, make use of the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.

Here is a visual example of how David Lewis used keyframes to create bouncing animation on an element.
