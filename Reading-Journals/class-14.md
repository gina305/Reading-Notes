# Read: 14a - CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## CSS Transforms
The CSS 'transforms' property allows you to position and alter elements. The transform property comes with two different settings, 2D and 3D settings. Not all browsers support this property but support is growing. The transform property should be prefixed with vendor prefixes to gain the best support across all browsers. Here are the 2D transforms properties you can use to change the position or alter an element:

* rotate 
* matrix
* perspective
* perspective-origin
* scale 
* skew 
* transition
* transform-origin

The 3D settings have their own properties you can set as well.


## CSS Animations

CSS Animations let you gradually change an element from one style to another. Animations allow you more control than transitions and are useful when you need to have multiple states. You can use animation keyframes to set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition. To do so, make use of the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.

Here is a visual example of how David Lewis used keyframes to create bouncing animation on an element.

# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
Teamwork in software engineering leads to faster innovation and enables developers to quickly identify mistakes and find better solutions to problems. Duhigg (2016) reported that studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

Every team is different. To bring the best out in a team, you have to understand the team's norms and then influence those norms in a way that brings forth effective productivity.  A norm is a standard or pattern, especially of social behavior. In the case of teams, it is how teammates treated one another. To be an effective group, members' opinions should be heard, while remaining relevant to the task on hand. When working in a group, group members should take advantage of everyone’s relative strength. This increases collective intelligence. Collective intelligence is the process by which group members gather and share their knowledge to solve an issue. 

Effective groups share empathy for one another's opinion. A successful group encourages psychological safety. Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up," Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. 
All-in-all, the most effective groups foster a psychologically safe environment for the group members. Duhigg (2016) made a good point about groups when he pointed out that companies that try to optimize everything, sometimes forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations/discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel.
