# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
Teamwork in software engineering leads to faster innovation and enables developers to quickly identify mistakes and find better solutions to problems. Duhigg (2016) reported that studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

Every team is different. To bring the best out in a team, you have to understand the team's norms and then influence those norms in a way that brings forth effective productivity.  A norm is a standard or pattern, especially of social behavior. In the case of teams, it is how teammates treated one another. To be an effective group, members' opinions should be heard, while remaining relevant to the task on hand. When working in a group, group members should take advantage of everyone’s relative strength. This increases collective intelligence. Collective intelligence is the process by which group members gather and share their knowledge to solve an issue. 

Effective groups share empathy for one another's opinion. A successful group encourages psychological safety. Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up," Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. 
All-in-all, the most effective groups foster a psychologically safe environment for the group members. Duhigg (2016) made a good point about groups when he pointed out that companies that try to optimize everything, sometimes forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations/discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel.
