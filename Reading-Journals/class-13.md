# Local Storage

HTML5 Web Storage allows key/value pair data to be stored localy within the user's web browser. Data is stored per origin (which is comprised of a domain and protocol), allowing all pages on that origin can store and access the same data.

Browsers that support HTML Web Stroage include:

* Google Chrome v4+ and beyond
* Miscroft Edge v8+ and beyond
* Firefox v3.5+ and beyond
* Apple Safari v4+ and beyond
* Opera 11.5+ and beyond 

HTML web storage can store data in local storage or sessionn storage. Local storage stores data within the client's browser with no expiration date. Session storage stores data within the client's browser and is lost when the session ends.
