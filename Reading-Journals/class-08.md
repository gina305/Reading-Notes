## Positioning Elements
In CSS, every element is treated as if it exists in its own box. That "box" or element has padding, border and margin within it. You can control the position of the element by define the position or float property. An element can be positioned using positioning schemes such as normal flow, relative positioning, or absolute positioning.

    * Normal Flow - Shows each element using block level positioning, meaning each element will be shown on it's own line.
    * Relative Positioning - Shows the element relative to it's normal position.
    * Absolute  Positioning - Sow the element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

## Working with Screens & Resolution

Screens come in different sizes. For example, mobile phones have smaller screen sizes that tablets and laptops or desktops. You should style your webpage with the appropriate CSS styles to accommodate the screen size of the devices that visitors may use to visit your site.

## Layouts
Layouts determine the positioning of the elements of a webpage. A draft wireframe design is always recommended to plan your design. Layouts can be either fixed or liquid. Fixed layouts do not change in size as the browser window size changes. Liquid layouts stretch and contract as the browser window size changes.

## CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks make designing easier by providing predefined CSS stylesheets for use by web developers and designers. The stylesheets specify CSS design for  elements such as setting colors, layout, fonts, navbars, etc. To make use of a CSS framework by importing it using “@import” rule. The @import rule allows you to import a style sheet into another style sheet.
