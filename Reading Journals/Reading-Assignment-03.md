## About Lists
HTML lists allow you to display a group of related items in the form of lists. Lists can be ordered (noted by ```<ol>```), unordered (noted by ```<ul>```) or definition list (noted by ```<dl>```).

List elements contain list items (noted by ```<li>```) that define the contents of a list. 

Here is a visual example of how lists can be used:

![](<imgs/to-dos.png>)

## About Boxes
Each element in html lives in it's own box on which you can style using CSS. You can do things like change text color, border color and so on. This is done through applying CSS to each box to get the desired visual appearance.

## About Javascript If/Else Statements
In Javascript, If/Else statements are used to determine which part of your code should run based on certain conditions and values. Statements are ran based on whether or not a statement is evaluated as true (truthy) or false (false).
