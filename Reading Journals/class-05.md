## HTML Images

You can add images such as logos, photos, etc. to your webpage. To style you image, use the background-image protperty in CSS.Before adding and image to your html wenpage, make sure you have a logical directory/file structure for storing your images. You will need to know the location of your locally stored images or the full path of any images hosted outside of your environment. To add an img, use the ```<img>``` tag and set any desirec attributes.

For example ```<img src="https://www.switchcode.io/assets/images/switchcode-new-logo-11-478x478.png" title="Switch Code Logo" width="478" height="478">``` would render the following image:

Images often take longer to load than text, so it's a good idea to specify the size of the image when ddefining the img element. Also, where you place the image will determine how your image is displayed.

 ```<a href="https://www.switchcode.io">Switch Now<a>``` In this example, when the work "Switch Now" is clicked, the a HTTPS secure link to www.switchcode.io will be opened. Similarly, a link can be used to navigate to another element or to a local. file or directory such as an image stores in a /img directory.
