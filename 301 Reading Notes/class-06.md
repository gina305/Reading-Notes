## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
- Pair Programming has several uses in improving code. It allows users to:
  * Code more efficiently
  * Code collaboratively
  * Learn from fellow students/peers
  * Improve their social skills
  * Improve job readiness
  * Improve readiness for work environment

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
- The most beneficial aspect of pair programming I have found is the efficiency of code and being able to learn from peers. Sometimes coding alone can cause tunnel vision and take up time on issues that a colleague can help you get past more quickly. Also, being able to collaborate with a colleague reminds you of forgotten concepts and allows you to learn new things about the syntax that you may have not known before.

3. How does pair programming work?
- Pair programming works through the use of two roles:  the driver and the navigator. The driver is responsible for typing the code. The navigator is responsible for reviewing the overall "strategic" direction of the code and coming up with ideas for improvements. Typically, they roles switch between the two programmers during a pair programming session.
