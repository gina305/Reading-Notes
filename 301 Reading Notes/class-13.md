## Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
* CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) are the actions you can perform on application data. REST is paradigm of noun-verbs used to perform CRUD operations on application data.
If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
1. Install and require environments/dependencies (i.e. Cors, Express, Mongo etc).
2. Create routes that you wish to receive API requests on
3. Set your environment variables for use in your application (i.e. API keys, PORT, etcs.)
4. Define your API data structure. For example, if you will be serving data from your MongoDb, you could use Mongoose to define the database schema).
4. Test you API (you could use Thunderclient or Insomnia).
5. Document and publish information on how to use your API.
