# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
* As women employment in computer science declined,  their employment in medical, law and physical science increased.
Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
* Hundred of interviews conducted by researcher Jane Margolis at Carnegie Mellon University revealed that  families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls. Early exposure to technology (including simple shooting games or word processes), increases a studentâ€™s chances of getting into the tech field and perhaps helps them understand concepts presented in the computer science major.

When are diversity efforts most successful?
* Diversity efforts are most successful when they are supported by company leaders.
Why do diverse companies perform better?
* Diversity increases creativity and innovation amongst employees in a company.
Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
* People from diverse backgrounds sometimes think and reason differently. These differences allow colleagues to process problems differently. As a personal example, I worked in the IT field with a former basketball player. He was a very motivating person that used his past experiences with training and motivation techniques to help pull our team through some demanding work.
